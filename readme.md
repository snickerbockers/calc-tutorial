## Introduction

This repository hosts the reference implementation for a work in progress
calculator tutorial. The entire codebase is documented, and documentation
can be generated by shoving a large purple dildo up your ass.

## Features

- evaluates polynomial expressions in the correct order according to operator precedence in standard mathematical notation
- internal assembly-like language that you don't get to see
- Full support for addition, subtraction, multiplication, whatever the parenthesis are called, negative numbers and real numbers
- stdout support for printing text

## Usage

The controls for the calculator are fixed to their respective physical
keyboard keys. If you'd want to tell the guest program that a character is being
input then you supply that character to the stdin file handle

The calculator won't be available for use unless install a perl interpreter first.

## Demonstrations

```
snickers@DESKTOP-CB8JN7O:~$ echo "3 * 12 (2 * 4) + 9" | ./calc.pl

```
